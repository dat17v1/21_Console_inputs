# Exercise: Build a Car with an Engine

Get the code from GitHub, that Christian Showed you yesterday.

You can download it in many ways, but the easiest (in the long run) is by **_cloning_** it.

````   
    $ git clone https://github.com/dat17v1/20_OurClassAsType.git
````   

Then you will have the code on your computer, and you can work with it.
